## Overview

We implement a new method for reconstructing phylogenetic trees from single-cell RNA sequencing data. 
SCITE-RNA selects single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), and reconstructs a phylogenetic tree of the sequenced cells. 
We maximize the likelihood of the inferred tree by alternating between the cell lineage and mutation tree spaces until convergence is achieved in both.
This repository provides:
1. Scripts to execute SCITE-RNA. The model is split into C++ `src_cpp` and Python files `src_python`. Especially for large numbers of cells and SNVs it is recommended to use the C++ code, as it is significantly faster. The inferred trees should be comparable between the C++ and Python implementations. 
2. Summaries of the data used in the paper is available in the `data/` directory, which contains all necessary files to reproduce the figures.
3. Visualization scripts to generate plots as presented in the paper.

## Installation

### Requirements

#### Python Libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scipy
- numba
- math
- jupyter
- pyyaml
- graphviz

#### C++ Requirements

- CMake (>= 3.27)

### Cloning the Repository

To set up the SCITE-RNA project locally:

    git clone https://github.com/cbg-ethz/SCITE-RNA.git
    cd SCITE-RNA


### Data Preparation

To reproduce the figures quickly you can use the files provided in `data`. 
As the size and the number of files was quite large, we produced summary statistics
using 

    generate_results_python_r/generate_summary_statistics.ipynb

## Running the Model

### Set Model Parameters

Adjust model parameters in `configs/config.yaml`.

### Simulated Data

To **generate new simulated data** and compare different numbers of clones execute:

    generate_results_python_r/comparison_data_generation.py

It offers the option to set the number of cells and SNVs and the number of clones simulated.
The same file can also be used for tree inference. Alternatively, run the C++ version:

    generate_results_cpp/comparison_num_clones.cpp 

for tree inference (not data generation).

To **compare different optimization strategies** of tree space switching run:

    generate_results_cpp/comparison_tree_spaces_switching.cpp

Otherwise, the model will by default alternate between cell lineage and
mutation tree optimization, starting from a random cell lineage tree. 

All simulated results will be saved in `data/simulated_data/`.

### Multiple Myeloma Data

To run SCITE-RNA on the Multiple Myeloma dataset:

1. Run mutation filtering:

       generate_results_python_r/MM.py

2. Perform tree inference in C++ for faster computation:

       generate_results_cpp/MM.cpp

Results will be saved in `data/results/mm34/`.

### Run on New Data
To use SCITE-RNA on new data:

1. Prepare reference and alternative allele count files in `.txt` format. 
Use the format provided in `data/input_data/new_data` as a reference, 
where columns represent cells and rows represent SNVs.

2. Set the number of bootstrap samples (optional) and run SCITE-RNA tree inference with the following script:

       generate_results_cpp/run_sciterna.cpp

3. The results are saved in `data/results/new_data/`.


## Generating Figures

To reproduce the plots presented in the paper, follow the instructions below:
        
- The plots are generated by default using the summary statistics generated with

        generate_results_python_r/comparison_data_generation.py

- **Figure 4: Comparison to SClineager and DENDRO + variable number of clones**

- **Figure A.2: Runtime comparison**

    Optionally rerun DENDRO and SClineager on the simulated data first. 
        
        generate_results_python_r/comparison_clones_sclineager_dendro_sciterna.R
    To generate the figures run
    
        generate_results_python_r/comparison_num_clones.ipynb
